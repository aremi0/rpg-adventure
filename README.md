This is a personal 2D RPG game project created for fun and to strengthen my understanding of C++ and the new C++23 standard features.

## Requirements

To build this project, you will need:

*   **C++ Compiler**: Must support C++23.
*   **CMake**: Version 3.22 or higher.
*   **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (Graphics, Window, System, Audio modules).
*   **EnTT**: Open-source, header-only Entity Component System (ECS) library.

## Documentation

You can find detailed documentation in the `doc/` directory:

*   [Project Configuration & Setup](doc/project_setup.md): Explains the `.vscode` configuration and `CMakeLists.txt` file structure.
